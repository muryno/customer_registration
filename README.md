The project is segmented into three folders, one is database,
the second one is the screen, the third one is the utils.
The database contains the implementation for the sql dm,
 where I configured my database and did data class.
 Then the screen is where I implemented all my UI designs.
 The screen has a folder called registration_screen.
 It is segmented to a business logic and the UI.
  The registration_screen_mobx contains the business logic.
   On the utils folder that I discussed as the third one,
   I put all the functionalities and permissions required for the app to work.
    I implemented to get a device name, geolocation,
     I implemented the color to have a unique color.
     I inputted a generic input field,
     a permission class required field and Snack bars.
      I also implemented the class to write to the exit card.
       I have a test folder where I wrote all the tests.


Due to google restriction to read or write to an external file,
I used platform channel so requet for user permission
